# AWS Certified Solutions Architect-Professional SAP-C01 New Feb 2019 Version Exam

## TL;DR;

- The new exam has *75* questions that you have to finish within *3* hours (180 minutes) with a minimum passing score of 750 out of 1000. The official AWS exam page says the exam is 170 minutes, but that is actually incorrect. I took the exam and it is 180 minutes and not 170 minutes. 
- You won't pass the exam if you don't know about AWS Organizations, Difference between SCP vs IAM Policy, Cross-Region Disaster Recovery, AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM), AWS Server Migration Service (SMS), AWS Systems Manager, AWS CI/CD Tools (CodeCommit, CodeBuild, CodeDeploy, CodePipeline) and many more

## AWS Solutions Architect Professional Practice Exams in Udemy

Disclaimer: This is not an exam dump of the actual AWS exam.  

The questions in each set are carefully created and selected based on the 5 domains of the actual AWS Certified Solutions Architect Professional exam. Out of the 5 domains, there are a lot more questions on *Design for New Solutions and Continuous Improvement for Existing Solutions*, as these are the topics with the heaviest weight in the actual exam (29%). Take Note that although there is a focus on these topics, the questions are all still unique, to ensure that you fully grasp the topic.

Some people are using exam dumps for the AWS Certified Solutions Architect certification exam which is totally absurd and highly unprofessional because these dumps will not only hinder you to attain an in-depth AWS knowledge, these can also result with you failing the actual AWS exam since the AWS team regularly updates the exam coverage.

There are a lot of existing AWS Practice Tests in the market however, most of them contain both technical and grammatical errors that is not only annoying but may also cause you to fail the actual exam. There's also the official certification practice exam provided by AWS but these only have a few questions and cost about $50 USD -- a price that is more expensive than taking these 300 Unique and Timed AWS Certified Solutions Architect Professional practice questions!


## Final Tips

1. Don't cram! If you are not ready to take the SAP-C01 exam, then just re-schedule it to a later date. Haste makes waste!
2. Read the question first and then look at the options. Most of the time, you will notice that there are two seemingly similar options which only differs in one or several keywords. This will help you eliminate the wrong options much easier. 
3. Take the free AWS Exam Readiness course in https://aws.training and other free courses/videos there.
